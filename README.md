# Go There, Do This!

Go There, Do This! is a travel app that allows authenticated users to log trips.  In the future it will be built out to save more information like activities, restaurants, and general recommendations about locations.

## Test out the app!

## Planning and Development Process
###Front-end

My primary focus was to design a simple minimum viable product, and leave a lot of space to grow the app after my initial project sprint deadline.  With only four days, I had to scale down my vision, and then build out future iterations for myself when I have more time.  I also challenged myself to use React, which is a very new framework to me, so I focused heavily on making sure a user could login, and then perform CRUD actions on their trip resource.

I tried to work in a very structured way, and only moving onto my next task once the previous one was complete with no errors.  I only wanted to commit completed features.  There were some things I could push off until version 2, but anything that I needed to meet MVP was made a top priority.

Whenever I ran into an issue on this project, I would write down exactly what was going on, and what I wanted to accomplish, and then step away from my project.  Often giving myself a break from coding was enough to see where my mistake was.  If not, I would google!  Stack overflow, the React docs, and youtube were all great resources for me.  I also used console.log often to check what I was saving in state and what I was passing through was actually what I thought.


#### User Stories
As a user I want to sign up, sign in, change my password, sign out.
As a registered user I want to create a new trip that has a destination, start and end dates, and a title (think Amandaâ€™s Wedding or College Reunion).
As a registered user I want to edit my trip.
As a registered user I want to delete my trip.
As a registered user I want to see all of my trips.

### Future Goals
I would like Go There, Do This! to build out into a more robust site in the future.  I want each trip listing to have additional information linked to it, like restaurant and activity recommendations, and maybe lodging and transportation information.  I would also like to incorporate the Yelp API or another travel site to provide more information.  It would also be nice if users could share their trip listings with friends.  I am excited to have so many options of how to expand this app in the future.

### Challenges
My main challenge was working with a new framework in a really tight deadline.  I had to prioritize what I wanted to accomplish, and I knew that working with React was my top priority.  From there I had to accept that working with new technology means moving at a slower pace, and learning along the way, and this also meant learning how to think in React and in components, and state, and props.  I also had to remind myself to focus on a functional app, and leave styling for later.
